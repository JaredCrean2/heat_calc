The EPW file from the EnergyPlus website (https://energyplus.net/weather) have lots of gaps in them.  To fill in those gaps,
the DIYEPW python package (https://github.com/IMMM-SFA/diyepw) can be used.
This package uses NOAA weather data to augment the EPW file.
The package is capable of generating EPW files for years for
which there is no EPW source data, which is unusual because
solar radiation is not contained in the NOAA data.
I think what happens is solar data for other years is used,
which is OK because the EnergyPlus data is Typical Meterological Year (TMY) data, which attempts to average out the experimental data based on
some kind of model.  So I think it is ok to use solar data from
other years.

How to use the package:
  1. Install DIYEPW.  According to their (current) readme, this can be done with `pip install diyepw`
  2. Figure out the WMO station code.  One way to do this is to
     go to the EnergyPlus website (https://energyplus.net/weather) and
     search for your location.  The results will show one or more
     result, which are a location name followed by a 6 digit code.
     The 6 digit code is the WMO code.
  3. Use the script DIYEPW provides to generate EPW files as:
 
create_amy_epw_files_for_years_and_wmos --years=2010-2015 --wmo-indices=723650 --output-path .

  This will generate one EPW file for each year, with complete data.
